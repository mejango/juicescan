# Thorough test coverage — transactions + views

## 2026-10-03 — publication endpoint recovery
- [x] Diagnose the custom testnet domain failure using keyless public health, schema and known-project reads.
- [x] Extract one shared endpoint owner without changing destinations; verify and commit the refactor separately.
- [ ] Switch the testnet owner to the healthy official Railway origin and update behavioral regressions.
- [ ] Measure the pinned Node 22 build, align the distribution budget with the recorded release delta, and run release checks.

### Review
The custom testnet domain returns Railway 502, while the source-documented Railway origin serves the current four Sepolia chains, full schema, and known V6 Base Sepolia project 13 (kmac's shop / KMAC). Keyless CORS remains limited to the configured retail origin, so browser requests retain the existing keyed route. The behavior-preserving shared-origin refactor passes 32 focused tests in 6 files and produces byte-identical learn/build HTML; both destinations remain unchanged in its separate commit. Endpoint switch and final release validation pending.

## 2026-10-03 — custom ruleset duration decimals
- [x] Verify the focused existing baseline (5 files, 65 tests) and trace typing, conversion, draft and queue consumers.
- [x] Add a real-browser regression for sequential decimal typing and preserve input focus/raw text.
- [x] Share strict custom-duration conversion across state updates, imports and launch/queue validation; retain draft persistence and refresh all duration-dependent controls while typing.
- [x] Verify behavioral tests, source syntax, bundle and Chromium regressions; document results.

### Review
The number input and full render discarded a trailing decimal point and focus: Chromium reproduced `4.` becoming `4`. A text input with the decimal keyboard now preserves raw text; scoped focus/caret restoration keeps the existing render, draft persistence, summaries, Afterwards choices, approval controls and split locks synchronized. One strict converter owns rounding to seconds and validates positive custom durations within uint32 bounds; imported custom stages rederive seconds, and launch/queue builders and deploy controls reject invalid values. Existing split locks survive incomplete custom text and clear only for an explicit Flexible choice.

Validation: all 181 unit-test files / 1810 tests pass, including 23 new duration regressions; all 24 Chromium modal tests pass across desktop/tablet/mobile/narrow viewports. The browser regression proves sequential `4.5` / `.5`, native unit activation, mid-value caret edits, draft persistence, dependent-control updates and one-click Next. Source syntax (269 files), bundle, distribution budget (2,243,839 B gzip / 2,244,000 B limit) and `git diff --check` pass. No commit, publish or generated ABI/deployment edits.

Pattern: extract inline `executeTransaction({...})` arg-building into a pure exported `buildXArgs(...)`
returning `{address, abi, functionName, args, value}`; component calls it (spread / Object.assign);
unit test round-trips through the contract ABI + asserts amounts/decimals/recipients/slippage.

## Review
91 vitest tests (8 files) + 9 UI smoke, all green. Build clean. Branch: audit-fixes-tx-security-and-tests.
Uncommitted — left for review.

## 2026-07-28 — kmac88 operator feedback (metadata round-trip, pay notice, kept fields, reserved-split removal)
- [x] Tests first: test/metadata-edit-roundtrip.test.js (merge helper, payDisclosure semantics, kept-keys helper, modal wiring)
- [x] Tests first: test/reserved-splits-empty.test.js (empty-group payload, empty setSplitGroupsOf encode, queue 0% reserved, UI copy)
- [x] 1. mergeProjectMetadataEdit: spread live projectUri JSON, overwrite only dirty form fields; fail closed when live JSON unreadable (submitProjectEdit + addStoreCategories)
- [x] 2. Payment notice textarea in edit-project modal (payDisclosure key, untouched≠cleared)
- [x] 3. "Other fields kept: …" read-only line from unmanagedProjectMetadataKeys(loadedMeta)
- [x] 4a. Verify queue flow encodes reservedPercent 0 with no reserved recipients (test only — already derived from row sum)
- [x] 4b. Reserved-splits modal: link "queue a new ruleset with a 0% reserved rate" → openQueueRulesetModal
- [x] 4c. Allow submitting an EMPTY reserved group (drop "Add at least one recipient" gate; owner-accrual explainer; locked rows already frozen)
- [x] Full suite + drift gates + bundle green; no commit

### Review
Root causes: (1) edit-project save fell back to `{}` when the live projectUri JSON couldn't be fetched, and always overwrote all known fields (degrading untouched rich descriptions); (4) submitSplitsEdit hard-refused an empty recipients list ("Add at least one recipient"), and the 0%-reserved lever actually lives in queue-ruleset (rate = sum of reserved rows — already encodes 0 with no rows, now test-locked).
Changes: mergeProjectMetadataEdit + unmanagedProjectMetadataKeys + loadLiveProjectMetadata (fail-closed, shared with addStoreCategories); dirty-tracked form fields; Payment notice (payDisclosure) textarea; "Other fields kept:" line; buildSplitsEditPayload allows empty groups; owner-accrual explainer + queue-ruleset deep-link in the reserved editor; "Splits cleared" status.
Tests: test/metadata-edit-roundtrip.test.js (10) + test/reserved-splits-empty.test.js (11). Full suite 94 files / 674 tests green; check:source/deployments/generated/transaction + bundle budget green. Uncommitted.

## 2026-07-28 — reserved-splits card + editor (6 defects, confirmed onchain)
kmac88's Base Sepolia projects have NO splits on any ruleset and reservedPercent = 0 everywhere — the
"100% to an address" they saw was fabricated by our UI.
- [x] Tests first: test/reserved-splits-card.test.js (36 tests, one describe per defect)
- [x] D1 fillSplits → renderSplitsInto: empty group renders PROSE, never a synthesized 100% owner row; leftover row only when the group has recipients; owner LABEL beside the address (funds-card payouts row too)
- [x] D2 editor switched to GROUP-SHARE percentages (rows sum to 100% of the group, like jbm/revnet/juicy); issuance equivalent is derived read-only text; buildSplitsEditPayload(rows) takes no limit → the 0-limit dead end is gone
- [x] D3 rows show issuance share + "(x% of limit)" companion (jbm idiom); section note when reservedPercent is 0
- [x] D4 createRulesetSplitsLoader(project) — every read takes its CHAIN; cache keyed chain:ruleset; ensureUpcoming + openEditSplitsModal + lock duration follow the selected chain
- [x] D5 editor names the ruleset id/cycle it verified and warns when it differs from the card's
- [x] D6 JBSplits.splitsOf fallback (ruleset 0) read per chain; clearing blocked when the fallback is non-empty; fails closed on read error (mirrors juicy-vision SetSplitsForm)
- [x] Full suite + drift gates + bundle + playwright green; no commit

### Review
Root causes: (1) `fillSplits` synthesized a leftover row for an EMPTY group and wiped the owner label when
project.owner was known; (2) `verifiedLimit = reservedPercent/100` was 0 and consumed unguarded, so the
editor showed "0% of 0% limit" and rejected every percentage; (4) `faPid`/`faHome` were captured once from
the home chain while the chain dropdown swapped in another chain's ruleset id; (6) `JBSplits.splitsOf`
falls back to ruleset 0 when a group is empty (JBSplits.sol:154-159), so "clearing sends tokens to the
owner" only holds when the fallback group is empty.
New exports: renderSplitsInto, splitShareDisplay, splitsEditorTotalText, splitsEditorRulesetNotice,
splitsClearGuard, createRulesetSplitsLoader. Removed: splitLimitPctFor (dead once percentages are group
shares), the reserved-limit drift check in submitSplitsEdit (encoding no longer depends on the rate).
Tests: test/reserved-splits-card.test.js (36 new) + test/reserved-splits-empty.test.js retargeted to
group-share semantics. 95 files / 722 tests green; check:source/deployments/generated/transaction, bundle
budget (1,893,827 B gzip of 2,050,000 B) and 44 playwright tests green. Uncommitted.
