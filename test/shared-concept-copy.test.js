/**
 * The definitions in PROTOCOL_CONCEPTS are duplicated into juicebox-money
 * (src/lib/protocol-concepts.ts) and revnet-money (src/lib/protocolConcepts.ts) because the
 * three clients are separate repos with no shared package. Three copies of one source of truth
 * is the exact divergent-duplication failure the 2026-08 audit spent its time removing, and
 * nothing else stops these from drifting apart sentence by sentence.
 *
 * So: hash the entries all three clients carry, and pin it. The constant below is IDENTICAL in
 * all three repos, which makes cross-repo agreement checkable by eye — grep SHARED_CONCEPT_HASH
 * in the other two and compare.
 *
 * This app carries a SUBSET (it has no loans UI, so no prepaid fee), which is why the hash
 * covers only the shared keys rather than the whole map.
